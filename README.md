## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Made mostly using HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript to control the selection on the popout menu. 

## Optimizations

Switched from thumbnails of my websites to gifs, but the files were large, so I compressed and optimized the gifs to be small enough to load the page quickly while being comparable file size to the original thumbnails. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that file size really matters a lot for a website, and making sure it is lightweight and can load quickly while still being able to have the content that will make the site more interesting.
