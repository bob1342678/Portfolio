# My Portfolio
This is my professional portfolio website.  I display my recent freelancing work and personal projects here, as well as links to my github, socials, and other ways to contact me.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Made mostly using HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript to control the selection on the popout menu. 

## Optimizations

Switched from thumbnails of my websites to gifs, but the files were large, so I compressed and optimized the gifs to be small enough to load the page quickly while being comparable file size to the original thumbnails. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that file size really matters a lot for a website, and making sure it is lightweight and can load quickly while still being able to have the content that will make the site more interesting.  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
